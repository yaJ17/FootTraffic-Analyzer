Project Overview – I am currently developing a foot traffic analysis dashboard to help the users, which is a government agency, to allocate their resources efficiently and help in urban planning and data on congested area.

Tech Stack – I will be using React.js (for frontend), Flask/python (for backend), Firebase (for authentication), and Plotly (for graphs). Since we are a team, my task is to just make the front end so focus on making the front end, but please create create empty files for the backend so we can just easily put the code of the model we trained. For now, use dummy data and put it in json file. Just check the images for the data. Make sure that the routing is also correct as well as the structure should be professional. This is the code for my firebase.
<script type="module">
  // Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
  import { initializeApp } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/11.6.0/firebase-app.js";
  // TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
  // https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

  // Your web app's Firebase configuration
  const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyBgSU1plo0po4C6XnzweoIGHyhZo2ASK7k",
    authDomain: "foottech-af93a.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "foottech-af93a",
    storageBucket: "foottech-af93a.firebasestorage.app",
    messagingSenderId: "942697824763",
    appId: "1:942697824763:web:3ee3eb1908bad319720b5e"
  };

  // Initialize Firebase
  const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
</script>

UI/UX Details – VERY IMPORTANT! Make it your priority to refer on the images for the design and make sure you can get it just like that as well as the color. Use icons to make it visually appealing.

Features – It has 7 different modules. Sign in, signup, dashboard, profile, charts,calendar,reports. 

signin and signup page - I used firebase for the authentication. The user should be redirected to the dashboard after the successfully signin in. If they sign up, they should be redirected to the sign in page to sign in. 

Profile page is where the users should be able to enter their details and edit it. 

Dashboard where there is KPI for the number of people, the peak hours, a map of Manila , a pie graph which has the number of foot traffic of the week per day, line graph for forecasting the avg foot traffic, and the dwell time using stacked  bar graph. The sidebar should be expandable and collapsible. Use the logo I uploaded. Make sure the logo is visible. 

Charts where they will see a heatmap, list of the congested area, and customizable metric like the location, time period, for the foot traffic and dwell time. 

calendar module. Similar to the calendar in canvas(please refer to the image), in this module, it will show the events in manila like festivals, etc to help LGU make better plans on allocating their resources. They should also be able to add task in the side, select a date, then that task will reflect on the cell of the date it is due.

Reports- They should be able to see the list of places and the columns of all of the factors. Also include interpretation of the predictive/forecasting model.
